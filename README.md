# Crypto-currency & Wallet
An independent crypto-currency alongwith a frontend wallet developed by me.
Blockchain is built over Python, and Flask framework was used to integrate the frontend.
This is very basic example of how a crypto-currency would function, with the involvment of client as well as the miner.
